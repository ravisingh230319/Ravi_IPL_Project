# IPL Data Project 1
This project is used to transform raw data of IPL to calculate the following stats:-

* Number of matches played per year for all the years in IPL.
* Number of matches won per team per year in IPL.
* Extra runs conceded per team in the year 2016.
* Top 10 economical bowlers in the year 2015.

For the last problem where we have to calculate the top 10 economical bowlers I have done the assumptions that bowlers conceding total runs less are economical.
